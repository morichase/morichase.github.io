<h3 style="text-align:center;">What Exactly Is Dark Souls?</h3>
<p>Dark Souls is a three part <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_role-playing_game">action RPG video game</a> series created by the studio <a href="http://www.fromsoftware.jp/pc_en/">FromSoftware</a>. This game immerses players in a captivating yet cruel and extremely dark fantasy universe that players will fight their way through as they take on grotesque monsters and daunting bosses. Like many RPGs Dark Souls involves a level up system where players collect experience points from defeating enemies in the form of "souls" which they can spend to make their character stronger. Players will typically find themselves eager to explore new areas in these games to the beautiful environments and enthralling level designs, but at the same time will have a constant sense of dread over what might be around the next corner.</p>

<h3 style="text-align:center;">Dark Souls: A Cult Classic</h3>
<img src="http://pre14.deviantart.net/f9e6/th/pre/f/2014/361/6/6/praise_the_sun_by_immp-d8bfvos.jpg" style="float:right;max-height:50%;padding:10px;">
<p>Since the initial 2011 release of the original Dark Souls game (not counting its spiritual predecessor <a href="http://www.atlus.com/demons-souls/">Demon's Souls</a>), the Dark Souls franchise has developed into a huge cult classic amongst video gamers from around the world.</p>

<p>But in a world where medieval inspired fantasy games saturate the video game market, what separates Dark Souls from the rest?</p>

<p>For many what attracted them to Dark Souls was its notorious level of difficulty. For any video game that revolves around fighting and combat, players typically play with the assumption that they will die once in awhile.</p>
<p>However in Dark Souls death is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aQQeb5Ne9Ew">commonplace</a> as players will find themselves dying to dragons, zombies, demons, grass, mushrooms, traps, butterflies, and most commonly rolling off a cliff into oblivion. In fact most players find a good chunk of their playtime dedicated to staring at a huge and insulting game-over screen that simply reads "YOU DIED". Not only is death more common in this game, but death also brings higher stakes as players loose any experience points that they are holding onto upon dying and are sent to the last bonfire or checkpoint.

<p>So for a game that sounds very punishing and even downright sadistic in some cases, why do so many players keep coming back to this franchise?

<div id="III." class="bluebg">
<h3 style="text-align:center;">The Big Appeals Of Dark Souls</h3>
<p>Despite the frustration that can come with losing most of your progress upon death or getting squished over and over again by the same boss or even by the same normal enemy, the Dark Souls franchise has managed to captivate countless people over the course of many years and three games. Some of the big appeals that have kept gameres coming back for more are listed as followed:</p>

<i><u><h4 style="text-align:left;margin-left:15px;">Level of difficulty</h4></u></i>
<img style="float:right;width:40%;margin:5px;" src="https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Kocc3f43S2FGz_UlT26aUFLh2F0=/475x0:5335x3240/1280x854/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/48962191/dark-souls-3-screenshot-1.0.0.jpg">
<p>Dark Souls may be a bit more challenging than some other games, but it also does a great job of remaining fair. Players will be met with failure after failure, but the entire game is shaped around learning from one's mistakes and especially from one's death. Things may seem initially impossible at times but after a few tries players will find themselves slowly improving until their goal is met.</p>
<p>Because of the constant failures, any success in Dark Souls is all the more satisfying to a point where it is addicting. Players actually feel like they accomplished a great feat when slaying a tough boss or getting through a hazardous area unlike some other games where players will breeze through a boss that was supposed to be powerful.</p>
<i><u><h4 style="text-align:left;margin-left:15px;">Combat System</h4></u></i>
<p>In addition to the healthy amount of challenge, the game features an exciting and fast-paced combat system. Players feel immersed in the intensity of the battle and feel like every action matters. In Dark Souls winning or losing a battle is more dependent on player skill rather than the level of the character. Every battle, be it against a daunting demi-god or even against a unassuming foot soldier, feels intense and meaningful.</p>
<i><u><h4 style="text-align:left;margin-left:15px;">Beautiful Game Design</h4></u></i>
<img style="float:left;width:40%;margin:10px;" src="https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/5f/48/bf/5f48bfc44c4c44d06844c06b6f22f3db.jpg">
<p>Despite being set in a decrepit, apocalyptic hellscape, full of some of the most hideous and horrifying creatures, Dark Souls manages to still bring forth some truly amazing instances of art through character and level design.</p>

<p>The environmental art of Dark Souls is not only beautiful but also highly interactive as players have the opportunity to thoroughly explore huge interconnecting levels with little to no loading screens. Furthermore, FromSoftware puts so much attention to detail that the enviornments themselves tell additional stories and add to the lore of the game.</p>

<p>Enemies especially showcase the amazing art of the franchise through the balance of beauty and horror. Before even fighting something, players already are instilled with a sense of dread based on design alone. This goes a step further with boses as Dark Souls has showcased some of the most memorable boss designs in video game history. Every boss design feels unique and helps bring out the lore behind these characters.</p>

<h3 style="text-align:center;">Misconceptions and Drawbacks</h3>
<img style="float:right;margin:10px;width:40%;" src="http://i1380.photobucket.com/albums/ah161/morichase/15289075_1404613366229555_3751908601717262177_o_zpsqaarlfmg.jpg">
<p>Despite the game becoming such a huge success, many are still apprehensive to picking it up. The most common reason seems to be stemming from a misconception that the game is only playable if you're a "skilled" hardcore gamer.</p>
<p>However, this is simply not true as any video gamer could pick it up and finish it given they possess the patience to take the time to learn and adapt. Rather, this supposed exaggerated "legendary" difficulty is a unfortunate by-product of the elitist gamer mentality coming from certain pockets of the Dark Souls community.</p>
<p>These self-proclaimed Dark Souls "pros" attempt to act as gatekeepers turning away potential new players or critques of the game calling them things like "filthy casuals" because they don't fully understand things yet or don't like the game. These elitist gatekeepers want to exaggerate the difficulty as much as possible while preventing as many people as possible from completing the game so that their completion of the game feels more significant and meaningful.</p>
